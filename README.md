## Installation

### Method #1 (Use existing color palette)

1) Enable chrome developer mode
2) Download the .crx extension from the releases page found at https://github.com/andr-dev/Chromethesia/releases
3) Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable the "Developer Mode" toggle in the top right corner
4) Drag the .crx file into the extensions window and click "Add Extension"

No additional setup is required.

### Method #2 (Customize color palette)

Currently, the color values are hard coded into a file called background.js in a data table at the top of the file. First, download the source code of the latest release found at https://github.com/andr-dev/Chromethesia/releases. Extract the zip and open a file called background.js with a code editor. Edit the hex color values to your preference and then save the file. To install the extension, go to chrome://extensions/ and enable the "Developer Mode" toggle in the top right corner. Then, select load unpacked and select the extracted folder where you made the edits. Chromesthesia should now be installed!
